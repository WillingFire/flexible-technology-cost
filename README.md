# flexible-technology-cost
This factorio mod allows you to adjust cost of infinite technologies to your liking. By default it keeps vanilla scaling for first few levels and after that it lessens ramp-up. You can either set those costs to flat value or set your own scaling.

This repository has been created with the intention of letting anyone interested in creating compatibility patches with other mods see the source code.
